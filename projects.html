              <p>As part of my Higher Computing Science course, a student had to create a static website about a television show or movie that they liked. I chose to create a website about the show Mr.Robot. To do this i used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. Below is a link to a GitHub Repo containing the code for this site. Feel free to check it out</p>

              <h1><u>Lyric finder site</u></h1>
              <p>As part of my Advanced Higher Computing Science course a student had to create a web application that had a front and back end. I chose to create a site that allowed a user to find a song name from song lyrics. The website would take the users input and compare it to a database filled with lyrics. If the user inputed data matched part of a lyric it would then show the user the song, the album and the artist their lyric was from. I used HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL to create this website. Below is a link to a GitHub Repo containing the code for this site. Feel free to check it out!</p>

              <p>As part of one of my second year university modules students were tasked with creating an ATM simulator that showed examples of a data race and non data race condition when taking out money from the same account at the same time. The non-data race mode would utilise a lock we implemented and the non
              data race would not. </p>

              <p>As part of one of my second year university modules in AI a group of five students were given the task of coming up with a project and creating a presentation on the work we did. When researching our group found a very interesting data set containing a series of medical drugs and their related side effects. I decided to make a webpage to show the findings to other people as i thought it was an interesting area.</p>
