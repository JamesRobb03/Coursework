              <h1><u>Troll Slayer</u></h1>
              <p>In my third year of University I took a game design module. For the coursework of this module
              students had to design and make a game of their choice. I chose to make a 2D platformer using the Godot Engine.
              Troll Slayer is based around platforming and boss fights, it used the Entity Component System design pattern alongside the singleton design pattern and the game loop design pattern.</p>

              <p>As part of one of my second year university modules, students were given the task of coming up with a project and creating a presentation on the work we did. When researching online, I found a very interesting data set containing a series of medical drugs and their related side effects. Using python I bla bla bla to the data to find this. I created a quick webpage to show the findings of the research which can be visited by clicking the link below</p>

              <h1><u>Lyric finder website</u></h1>
              <p>As part of my Advanced Higher Computing Science course a student had to create a web application that had a front and back end. I chose to create a site that allowed a user to find a song name from song lyrics. The website would take the users input and compare it to a database filled with lyrics. If the user inputed data matched part of a lyric it would then show the user the song, the album and the artist their lyric was from. I used HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL to create this website. Below is a link to a GitHub Repo containing the code for this site. Feel free to check it out!</p>

The non-data race mode would utilise a lock we implemented and the non
              data race would not. </p>
